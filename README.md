This is my personal portfolio website built with React.js and Bootstrap, showcasing my skills and projects. The website is designed and created entirely by me, Rahul Vijay.

## Features

- **Multiple Pages (React Router):** The website is built with React Router v6 to enable easy access to multiple pages, showcasing various aspects of my skills and projects.

- **Fully Responsive:** The website is fully responsive and works flawlessly on all devices, ensuring a seamless user experience across different screen sizes.

- **Modern Design:** The portfolio website features a modern and visually appealing design, utilizing animations to add an interactive touch to the user interface.

## Deployment

The website is correctly bundled with React in production mode, ensuring optimized build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes to improve caching.
